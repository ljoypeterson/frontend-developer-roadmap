## Before Start 
You can skip this but if you want to be a passionate and one of the best front-end developer I will suggest you, you need to follow/learn this things first: 

Learn at-least basics one of this programming language. I suggest to learn C language.

#### 1. C 
The C programming language is a general-purpose, low-level language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. Known for its efficiency and portability, C is widely used in system programming, such as operating systems, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications. It features a simple syntax with control structures like loops and conditionals, and it provides direct memory access through pointers. C programs are compiled into machine code, making them fast and efficient. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0
}
```
