## Before Start 
You can skip this but if you want to be a passionate and one of the best front-end developers I will suggest you, you need to follow/learn this thing first: 

Learn at-least basics of one of these programming languages. I suggest learning C language.

#### 1. C 
The C programming language is a general-purpose, low-level language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. Known for its efficiency and portability, C is widely used in system programming, such as operating systems, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications. It features a simple syntax with control structures like loops and conditionals, and it provides direct memory access through pointers. C programs are compiled into machine code, making them fast and efficient. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0
}
```

#### 2. C++
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of C, adding object-oriented features and other enhancements. Released in 1985, it combines C's efficiency and low-level control with high-level features for complex software development. Here is a simple "Hello, World!" example:

```C++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### 3. Python 
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991, Python emphasizes ease of learning and use. Its features include dynamic typing, a large standard library, cross-platform compatibility, and support for both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. Python is widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and more. It's characterized by its clean and concise syntax, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. "Hello, world!" example:

``` python
print("Hello, World!")
```

#### 4. Java
Java is a platform-independent, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. It emphasizes security, robustness, and portability. With automatic memory management and a rich standard library, Java is widely used for web, enterprise, and mobile development. Its bytecode can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM). "Hello, world!" example:

```Java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Learn Basics(HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Hopefully, Now you know the basics of programming, Now you can jump into learning the Basics of Front-end development. Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is mandatory for a Front-end developer. So stay focused and learn step by step of HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

#### 1. HTML 

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) forms web pages using elements, tags, and attributes. Semantic HTML organizes content meaningfully, enhancing accessibility and SEO. Key elements include headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and forms. Practicing HTML involves creating basic web pages to solidify comprehension. Understanding HTML's structure, semantics, and common elements is foundational for web development.

#### 2.CSS 
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language for web development. It controls the appearance of HTML elements by specifying their presentation, layout, and design. CSS enhances user experience by adding colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness to web pages. It separates content from design, enabling consistent styling across multiple pages. Understanding CSS is crucial for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites.
