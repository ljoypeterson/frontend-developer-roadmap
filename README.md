## Before Start 
You can skip this but if you want to be a passionate and one of the best front-end developer I will suggest you, you need to follow/learn this things first: 

Learn at-least basics one of this programming language. I suggest to learn C language.

#### 1. C 
The C programming language is a general-purpose, low-level language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. Known for its efficiency and portability, C is widely used in system programming, such as operating systems, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications. It features a simple syntax with control structures like loops and conditionals, and it provides direct memory access through pointers. C programs are compiled into machine code, making them fast and efficient. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0
}
```

#### 2. C++
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of C, adding object-oriented features and other enhancements. Released in 1985, it combines C's efficiency and low-level control with high-level features for complex software development. Here is a simple "Hello, World!" example:

```C++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### 3. Python 
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991, Python emphasizes ease of learning and use. Its features include dynamic typing, a large standard library, cross-platform compatibility, and support for both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. Python is widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and more. It's characterized by its clean and concise syntax, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. "Hello world!" example:

``` python
print("Hello, World!")
```

#### 4. Java
Java is a platform-independent, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. It emphasizes security, robustness, and portability. With automatic memory management and a rich standard library, Java is widely used for web, enterprise, and mobile development. Its bytecode can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM). "Hello world!" example:

```Java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
